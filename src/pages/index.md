I love to turn ideas into products in less than a week. If you have any idea and want to work with me, feel free to contact me at [iam@alanj.in](mailto:iam@alanj.in) or book a meeting with me at [https://cal.com/alanj/1h](https://cal.com/alanj). Check my previous projects at [Code Projects](/code).

I'm currently open to work during summer (late June to early October) and easter (mid March to late April). I'm open to work worldwide or remotely, but please note that I'll require a visa sponsorship if the job is outside of UK. I'm also open to work as a freelancer, but only during summer due to visa restrictions.
