## HiðŸ‘‹

I'm a programmer, a photography enthusiast, and a first year Computer Science student, and this is the website about some works I've done.

```scala
// It's a singleton, clearly
object Alan {
    val preferName = "Alan"
    val pronoun = "he/his/him"
    val job = ["student", "programmer"]
    val interest = ["photography", "civil aviation"]
    val education = [
        "University of Oxford",
        "Shenzhen College of International Education"
    ]

    def startDay(): Unit = {
        val coffee = new Coffee("Pret, Covered market street", "vanilla latte")
        coffee.consume()
    }
}
```

I'm currently seeking for an internship about Computer Science / Web development at UK (on a student Visa, can work full time during vacation)/China/Remote. Contact me at q@alanjin.me and I would be more than happy to have a cup of coffee with you :)
