## HiðŸ‘‹

I'm a programmer, a photography enthusiast, and a third year Computer Science student at University of Oxford, and this is the website about some works I've done.

I'm currently seeking for an internship about Computer Science / Web development at UK (on a student Visa, can work full time during vacation)/China/Remote. Contact me at iam@alanj.in and I would be more than happy to have a cup of coffee with you :)
